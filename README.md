# Angular-php-login-sample
This is a sample application that uses token authentication for an AngularJS project.
The application allows you to add, delete, edit(work in progress..) job posts.

The following stack is used in order to create the backend:
- Slim Framework for creating the API
- [PHP-JWT](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt).
- [Php-Login-Advanced](https://github.com/panique/php-login-advanced) for reference on how to do better authentication. At the moment, it seems
that it's no longer supported, but some of the principles on how to do authentication sill apply.
